# Better-Glass v1.0 LEGACY

WARNING: This pack is now outdated. It was originally made for Minecraft 1.13, however with the new re-textured glass there is no need for this pack anymore. Mojang did a much better job than me, anyway!

Better Glass is a resource pack for the massively popular sandbox game "Minecraft", to make glass look less scratched. It also modifies the colours to make them brighter and more cheerful!

You are free to modify this resource pack, and use the files in your own resource pack, but please give credit to the original creator (me, PixelOrangeDev/BlockyPenguin). Thank you.
