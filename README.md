# Better-Glass v1.0 LEGACY

WARNING: This pack is currently legacy. I do have plans to update it for 1.14, but they have been put on hold as result of a busy personal life. Thank you for understanding.
=======

Better Glass is a resource pack for the massively popular sandbox game "Minecraft", to make glass look less scratched. It also modifies the colours to make them brighter and more cheerful!

You are free to modify this resource pack, and use the files in your own resource pack, but please give credit to the original creator (me, PixelOrangeDev/BlockyPenguin). Thank you.
